# TicTacToe-Multiplayer

Sideproject, building a browser TicTacToe game with Javascript, CSS and HTML using a REST API so that opponents can play on different devices.


Notes:
1) Player 2 can now restart the game, cleaned the code and tried to comment the complicated parts

1) New version up in main, added some styling and a function to check if there is a winner. Next step is a checkDraw() function and a restartGame() .

2) Version 0.2 up in main, multiplaying working, and pages is live. Started a checkWinner function but its not complete

3) First draft on branch Version 0.1, got a bit to complicated and difficult to read and understand. In Version 0.2 I will redo the fundamentals, change out how the gameloop works and make it more readable. Design a shallower data structure to reduce the amount om API requests and get a better overview.
