# TicTacToe-Multiplayer

Sideproject, building a browser TicTacToe game with Javascript, CSS and HTML using a REST API so that opponents can play on different devices.


Notes:
2. Version 0.2 up in main, multiplaying working, and pages is live. Started a checkWinner function but its not complete

1. First draft on branch Version 0.1, got a bit to complicated and difficult to read and understand. In Version 0.2 I will redo the fundamentals, change out how the gameloop works and make it more readable. Design a shallower data structure to reduce the amount om API requests and get a better overview.
